# ThermUDP
UDP Server for DS1621 Thermometer, running in Python 3 on a Raspberry Pi.  Typical UDP reply packet follows:
```JSON
{"loResC": 25.5, "hiResC": 25.375, "hiResF": 77.675, "date": "10/19/2020", "time": "17:09:58"}
```
The DS1621 is a self-contained thermometer and thermostat made by [Maxim](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/DS1621.html) and available at [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/maxim-integrated/DS1621/956905).  It interfaces with I<sup>2</sup>C, and its power supply range includes both 3.3V and 5.0V, so you can either connect it directly to the RasPi [GPIO header](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) with 3.3V levels, or use a [level shifter](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN10441.pdf) to operate at 5.0V.  In my application is used a level shifter implemented with an [FDC6301N](https://www.onsemi.com/products/discretes-drivers/mosfets/fdc6301n) dual FET, as suggested by [AB Electronics](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/kb/article/1049/logic-level-converter).  You'll have to do some setup to get the RasPi talking with I<sup>2</sup>C, and details may vary depending on which RasPi you have.  I found the [SparkFun tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi-spi-and-i2c-tutorial#i2c-on-pi) to be helpful.  The UDP temperature server posted here uses the [smbus](https://raspberry-projects.com/pi/programming-in-python/i2c-programming-in-python/using-the-i2c-interface-2) library to let Python 3 talk to the DS1621.
